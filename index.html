                            <p>In Ohio, the average deviation of all simulated plans is .03, meaning that the Republican Party yields 53% of the seat share with 50% of the vote. The enacted plan has a deviation of .11, guaranteeing the Republican Party 61% of the seat share. <span style="font-weight: 600; color:#d3a029;">Because it yields more seat share with the same vote share, the enacted plan is more favorable to the Republican party than the majority of simulated plans.</span></p>

In districts where a party wins, any vote past 50% + 1 is a wasted vote. In districts where a party loses, any vote is a wasted vote. The efficiency gap is calculated from subtracting the number of lost Democratic votes from lost Republican votes. A positive efficiency gap indicates more Democratic votes are wasted.</p>
                            <p style="font-size:18pt !important;">In Florida, the average efficiency gap of all simulated plans is 0.06, while the efficiency gap of the enacted plan is 0.16. <span style="font-weight: 600; color:#d3a029;">The enacted map has an efficiency gap greater than 100% of all simulated plans</span>, showing that the enacted plan wastes Democratic votes at a much higher rate and gives an advantage to the Republican Party.</p>

                            <p>In Illinois, the average Polsby Popper score for all simulated plans is 0.26.

                <p class="step"><span style="font-family: 'Gerry', serif; font-size: 40pt;">W</span>ritten in Article 1 Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, state legislatures have the responsibility to redistrict their states every ten years after the Census.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="background-text">
                <p class="step">Naturally, those in power have an incentive to stay in power. By giving state legislators the responsibility to draw the exact districts they are elected from, those in power are able to select the exact voters they want, usually matching their own political party. This has inevitably led to an unfair redistricting practice called <span style="color:#8888ab; font-weight: 700;">gerrymandering</span>.</p>

                <p class="step"><span style="color:#8888ab; font-weight: 700;">Gerrymandering</span> is the practice of redistricting with the intent to disadvantage opposing political parties or advantage one's own political party.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="background-text">
                <p class="step">Thankfully, gerrymandering has become easier to uncover through the same process of how we analyzed metrics and maps above. This type of analysis was used by the Supreme Court in deciding two federal cases against the North Carolina and Alabama legislatures for unfair redistricting practices this past year.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="background-text">
                <p class="step">In order to combat gerrymandering, some state legislatures have outsourced their redistricting responsibility to <span style="color:#8888ab; font-weight: 700;">Independent Redistricting Commissions &#40;IRCs&#41;</span>. IRCs are made up of individuals that currently do not hold office, thereby removing the incentive to redistrict to one's advantage. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="background-text">
                <p class="step">After the 2010 U.S. Census, only Arizona, California, Idaho, and Washington had IRCs to redistrict. By 2020, Colorado, Michigan, Montana, and New York changed to IRCs. More states are beginning to see the value in shifting to IRCs, but <span style="color:#d3a029; font-weight: 700;">How can we tell if IRCs are less likely to gerrymander?</div>
