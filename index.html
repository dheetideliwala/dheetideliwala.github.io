            <br>
            <p>With each decade's population change, the number of representatives granted to each state is adjusted in order to preserve the proportional nature of the U.S. House of Representatives. This process of reassigning the number of representatives is called <span style="color:#8888ab; font-weight: 700;">reapportionment</span>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Along with potentially adjusting the number of Congressional districts after reapportionment, each state must also redraw their districts so each district has roughly the same number of people.</p>

                    <p>The census provides states with voting precincts, which are the building blocks combined together to create districts.</p>
                    <p>With thousands of precincts in each state, the number of maps that can be drawn are endless.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Fortunately, the U.S. Constitution and each state constitution include guidelines that ought to be followed, which reduces the number of valid maps that can be drawn.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Legally, districts must
                        <ul style="color:#8888ab; font-weight:700;">
                            <li>have equal population</li>
                            <li>be contiguous</li>
                            <li>be geographically compact</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Because of the complex nature of this question, some mathematicians have created algorithms to objectively redraw the districts for states, which follow the aforementioned guidelines.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These computational maps, however, would not respect<span style="color: #8888ab; font-weight: 700;"> existing municipalities, cities, counties, or communities of interest</span>- another guideline found in state constitutions.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>States could also redraw maps to give their party an advantage or to make each district maximally competitive, while still following constitutional guidelines.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But these maps could, and historically have, landed states in judicial battles about a person's right to vote and be represented fairly.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Constitutional rules give us a guiding framework to understand which maps are and aren't allowed. But for the thousands maps that do follow all the rules,</p>
                    <p style="color:#d3a029; font-weight: 700;">How can we tell which of maps are "better" than others?</p>

            <p>Using the census, VEST (Voting & Election Science Team), and geographical data tied to each potential map, different metrics about each map can be computed. These metrics can tell us geographical and partisan features about a map, like how many counties redrawn districts split or how many Democrats a map yields.</p>
            </br>
            <p>Compounding the metrics calculated from thousands of possible maps that follow constitutional guidelines, we can plot a histogram with all those values and note where one specific map lies in relation to the rest &#40;such as around the average, median, or an outlier&#41;.</p>
            </br>
            <p>Researchers are able to create thousands of possible maps through the process of  <span style="color:#8888ab; font-weight: 700;">Markov Chain Monte Carlo</span>. Once they create a large and representative sample of how one state might be redistricted, they can compare it to existing state maps using the metrics below.</p>

            <p>Written in Article 1 Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, state legislatures have the responsibility to redistrict their states every ten years after the population census.</p>
            </br>
            <p>Naturally, those in power have an incentive to stay in power. So, giving state legislators the responsibility to draw districts, and ultimately choose their voters, in a way that advantages them in elections opens up the possibility of unfair redistricting practices.</p>
            </br>
            <p>The practice of redistricting with the intent to disadvantage the opposing political party or advantage one's own political party is called <span style="color:#8888ab; font-weight: 700;">gerrymandering</span>.</p>
            </br>
            <!-- should add links here to SCOTUS cases -->
            <p>Thankfully, gerrymandering has become easier to uncover through the same process of how we analyzed metrics and maps above. That type of analysis was actually used in Supreme Court cases against the North Carolina and Alabama legislatures this past year.</p>
            </br>
            <p>In order to combat gerrymandering, some state legislatures have outsourced their redistricting responsibility to <span style="color:#8888ab; font-weight: 700;"></span>Independent Redistricting Commissions</span>. These are made up of individuals who do not hold office, thus removing the incentive to redistrict to one's advantage.</p>
            </br>
            <p>But<br><span style="color:#d3a029; font-weight: 700;">How can we tell if Independent Redistricting Commissions are less likely to gerrymander?</span></p>
