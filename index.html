            <p>Written in Article 1 Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, state legislatures have the responsibility to redistrict their states every ten years after the Census.</p>
            </br>
            <p>Naturally, those in power have an incentive to stay in power. So, giving state legislators the responsibility to draw districts, and ultimately choose their voters, in a way that advantages them in elections opens up the possibility of unfair redistricting practices.</p>
            </br>
            <p>The practice of redistricting with the intent to disadvantage the opposing political party or advantage one's own political party is called <span style="color:#8888ab; font-weight: 700;">gerrymandering</span>.</p>
            </br>
            <!-- should add links here to SCOTUS cases -->
            <p>Thankfully, gerrymandering has become easier to uncover through the same process of how we analyzed metrics and maps above. That type of analysis was actually used in Supreme Court cases against the North Carolina and Alabama legislatures this past year.</p>
            </br>
            <p>In order to combat gerrymandering, some state legislatures have outsourced their redistricting responsibility to <span style="color:#8888ab; font-weight: 700;"></span>Independent Redistricting Commissions</span>. These are made up of individuals who do not hold office, thus removing the incentive to redistrict to one's advantage.</p>
            </br>
            <p>But<br><span style="color:#d3a029; font-weight: 700;">How can we tell if Independent Redistricting Commissions are less likely to gerrymander?</span></p>
