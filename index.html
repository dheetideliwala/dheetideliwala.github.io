                <p class="step"><span style="font-family: 'Gerry', serif; font-size: 35pt;">W</span>ritten in Article 1 Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution, state legislatures have the responsibility to redistrict their states every ten years after the Census.<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 20pt"><a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-4/#:~:text=Clause%201%20Elections%20Clause,the%20Places%20of%20chusing%20Senators.">2</a></span></p>

                <p class="step">Naturally, those in power have an incentive to stay in power. By giving state legislators the responsibility to draw the exact districts they are elected from, those in power are able to select the exact voters they want, usually matching their own political party. This has inevitably led to an unfair redistricting practice called <span style="color:#8888ab; font-weight: 700;">gerrymandering</span>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="background-text">
                <p class="step"><span style="color:#8888ab; font-weight: 700;">Gerrymandering</span> is the practice of redistricting with the intent to disadvantage opposing political parties or advantage one's own political party.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="background-text">
                <p class="step">Thankfully, gerrymandering has become easier to uncover through the same process of how we analyzed metrics and maps above. This type of analysis was used by the Supreme Court in deciding two federal cases against the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-422/91120/20190307163214118_18-422%20Brief%20for%20Amicus%20Curiae%20Eric%20S.%20Lander.pdf">North Carolina</a> and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-807/275639/20230818110350391_22-807%20Alexander%20v%20SC%20State%20Conf%20of%20the%20NAACP%20BRIEF.pdf">South Carolina</a> state legislatures for unfair redistricting practices.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="background-text">
                <p class="step">In order to combat gerrymandering, some state legislatures have outsourced their redistricting responsibility to <span style="color:#8888ab; font-weight: 700;">Independent Redistricting Commissions &#40;IRCs&#41;</span>. IRCs are made up of individuals that currently do not hold office, thereby removing the incentive to redistrict to one's advantage. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="background-text">
                <p class="step">After the 2010 U.S. Census, only Arizona, California, Idaho, and Washington used IRCs to redistrict. By 2020, Colorado, Michigan, Montana, and New York switched to IRCs over their state legislatures.<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 20pt"><a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/national-overview/?colorby=Institution&level=Congress&cycle=2010">3</a></span> More states are beginning to see the value in shifting to IRCs, but <span style="color:#d3a029; font-weight: 700;">How can we tell if IRCs are actually less likely to gerrymander?</div>

Specifically, <span style="color: #8888ab; font-weight: 700;">we are looking to see if IRCs are less likely to produce maps that are statistical outliers when compared to 5,000 simulated plans</span>. In other words, whether or not IRCs produce maps that are similar to the large sample of unbiased, simulated maps.</p>

                <p class="step">For Expected Democratic Seats, the average percentile difference from 50% for all the states with an IRC is 7.66%, whereas the average percentile difference for the states without an IRC (non-IRCs) is 11.38%. With a lower percentile difference, <span style="color: #8888ab; font-weight: 700;">it seems IRCs are less likely to create plans that are outliers &#40;further from 50%&#41; in the number of Democratic seats they yield</span> compared to 5,000 objectively simulated plans.</p>

                <p class="step">For Partisan Symmetry, the average percentile difference for IRCs is 16.48% and for non-IRCs is 9.03%. For the other partisan metric, Efficiency Gap, IRCs' average percentile difference is 10.03%, while non-IRCs' is 22.13%. <span style="color: #8888ab; font-weight: 700;">It seems that non-IRCs are less likely to produce a statistical outlier for partisan symmetry, but IRCs are less likely to produce an outlier for efficiency gap</span>. This gives us an inconclusive answer of whether IRCs are better at avoiding partisan gerrymandering.</p>

            <div class="background-text">
                <p class="step">For Polsby Popper, the average percentile difference for IRCs is 9.17% and for non-IRCs is 6.37%. For County Splits, the average percentile difference for IRCs is 38.7% and for non-IRCs is 41.9%. Similar to the partisan metrics, the geographic metrics are also split, where <span style="color: #8888ab; font-weight: 700;">non-IRCs seem less likely to produce an outlier for Polsby Popper and IRCs seem less likely to produce an outlier for county splits.</span></p>
            </div>
            <div class="background-text">
                <p class="step">There doesn't seem to be a clear answer from 2020 if IRCs are better than non-IRCs in preventing gerrymandering under the five metrics reviewed. Because of different sample sizes for IRC vs. non-IRC &#40;8 vs. 40&#41;, state requirements for redistricting, and political/geographical variations between state to state, direct comparisons of percentiles could get foggy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="background-text">
                <p class="step">We can reduce the number of independent variables by directly comparing maps made by a legislature and by an IRC for the same state, with the same state requirements and political/geographical variations. The only differences now will be the entity that made the map and the year it was made for.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">There is no well-preserved shp.file for Montana's 2010 redistricting map, which is needed for the ALARM Project to create representative samples off of. Thus, we will only be analyzing three out of the four states that moved from state legislatures to IRCs from 2010 to 2020.</p>

                <p class="step">For three of the metrics, Expected Democratic Seats, Deviation from Partisan Symmetry, and Polsby Popper, IRCs in 2020 created maps that were in percentiles closer to 50% than their non-IRC counterparts in 2010.

                <p class="step"><span style="font-family: 'Gerry', serif; font-size: 35pt;">I</span>RCs are a relatively new invention in our democracy, spanning less than half a decade. Additionally, we only have maps from 2010 and 2020 in the form of file needed to perform MCMC, which leads to an extremely small sample size and makes it harder to perform quantitative analysis.</p>

                <p class=step><span style="color: #8888ab; font-weight: 700;">IRCs have made more competitive districts than the national average</span>. In Arizona, the average margin of victory was 28 points lower than the national average, alluding to the creation of less "safe" districts that are purposely drawn to protect a candidate or political party. California also saw more tossups across their districts than the national average.<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 20pt"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/02/upshot/independently-drawn-districts-have-proved-to-be-more-competitive.html">4</a></span></p>

                <p class=step>As more states understand the benefit of IRCs and separating the redistricting process from state legislatures, there is a steady trend of more IRCs, as well as politician, advisory, and backup commissions, across the nation.<span style="vertical-align: super; font-size: 20pt"><a href="https://redistricting.lls.edu/redistricting-101/who-draws-the-lines/">5</a></span> With this approaching rise in the sample size of IRCs, there can soon be more definitive and quantitative research on IRCs.</p>
